This react app represents the responsive card component.
It consists of two child components: Tile and Footer.

Tile component has one parameter which helps to chose the background image 
Footer component acepts one parameter which helps do define title.

If I have more time I would play around with css and place card differently because in case of cirtain screen resolutions in order to see whole card the user has to scroll down (currently I'm just fitting card using with = 100%) and it can be done diferently depends on requirements.

In addition, I would consider using React Native
